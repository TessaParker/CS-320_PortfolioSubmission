A portion of my first project completed for Software Automation and QA at SNHU as well as a summary report and reflections.

[1] How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By creating automated testing for each method that I write in a program, I can assure the utmost quality and functionality. This testing ensures that outlier cases are accounted for, caught and properly called when appropriate. I will be sure to implement best practices into my coding practices as I continue to learn how to build more secure code. 

[2] How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By conducting a thorough requirement elicitation, analysis, and design, I can ensure that I am addressing all of the user needs into a program. In this case, I accounted for the requirements stated in the rubric, thought of ways that I could congruously address these requirements and created a general outline for the structure of the program. Through implementation, I was able to troubleshoot any issues that arose and alter my design as necessary. 

[3] How do I approach designing software?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As stated above, I followed the work process of requirement elicitation -> analysis -> design -> implementation. 
All of these steps are crucial in the creation of a program that will address all user needs. If a step is overlooked, much time could be wasted in having to integrate basic functions at a later stage or rewriting the program to function cohesively. I have failed to adequately plan for a coding project in the past, sometimes having to dispose of several hours of work to start from scratch. As I continue to learn effective coding practices, I hope to continue to streamline these processes.
